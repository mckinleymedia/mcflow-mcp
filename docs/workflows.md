## Custom Instructions

### Creating Workflows

When creating new workflows in this repository, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names with kebab-case (e.g., `customer-data-sync`)
2. **Error Handling**: Always include error handling nodes for critical workflows
3. **Documentation**: Each workflow should have a clear description of its purpose
4. **Testing**: Test workflows in development before deploying to production
5. **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode credentials - use n8n credentials system

### Project-Specific Instructions

# Workflow Instructions

## Project-Specific Guidelines

Add your project-specific workflow creation and editing instructions here.

### Workflow Naming

- Use descriptive names that indicate the workflow's purpose
- Follow the pattern: `[action]-[target]-[frequency]` (e.g., `sync-customer-data-daily`)

### Required Components

Every workflow in this project should include:

1. **Error Handling**: Catch and handle errors appropriately
2. **Logging**: Log important events for debugging
3. **Notifications**: Alert on failures or important events
4. **Documentation**: Clear description in the workflow JSON

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used by workflows:

- `API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for API calls
- `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`: Email for alerts
- Add more as needed...

### Testing Requirements

Before deploying a workflow:

1. Test with sample data
2. Verify error handling works
3. Check performance with expected data volume
4. Document any dependencies

### Security Considerations

- Never hardcode credentials
- Use n8n's built-in credential management
- Validate all external inputs
- Implement rate limiting where appropriate

## Workflow Guidelines

### Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable sub-workflows
- **Monitoring**: Add logging and notification nodes for important events
- **Performance**: Optimize for efficiency, especially for high-volume workflows
- **Version Control**: Commit workflow changes with descriptive messages
- **Documentation**: Update this file when adding or modifying workflows

### Workflow Categories

Workflows in this project are organized by purpose:

- **Data Sync**: Workflows that synchronize data between systems
- **Automation**: Task automation workflows
- **Monitoring**: System monitoring and alerting workflows
- **Integration**: Third-party service integrations
- **Utility**: Helper and utility workflows
